# Practical Loops

This project consists of three parts: Fizz Buzz, Prime Time, and Feeling Loopy.

## Part 1: Fizz Buzz

This part of the project is a solution to the classic "Fizz Buzz" problem. The code loops through all numbers from 1 to 100 and logs different outputs based on the divisibility of the number.

- If a number is divisible by 3, it logs "Fizz."
- If a number is divisible by 5, it logs "Buzz."
- If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it logs "Fizz Buzz."
- If a number is not divisible by either 3 or 5, it logs the number itself.

## Part 2: Prime Time

This part of the project involves finding the next prime number after a given number, `n`. A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that cannot be exactly divided by any whole number other than itself and 1. 

The code declares an arbitrary number, `n`, and creates a loop that searches for the next prime number, starting at `n` and incrementing from there. As soon as it finds the prime number, it logs that number and exits the loop.

## Part 3: Feeling Loopy

This part of the project involves parsing a CSV string. The provided CSV string is split into rows, and each row is split into cells. The data from each cell is then logged.

The CSV string contains four columns: "ID", "Name", "Occupation", and "Age". The code splits the string into rows using the newline character (`\n`), and then splits each row into cells using the comma character (`,`). It then logs the data from each cell.

## Running the Program
To run this program, you need a JavaScript environment like Node.js. Save the program in a file, say script.js, and run it with the command node script.js.You can also use index.html file to be opened on your browser to inspect and console will display calculations.
